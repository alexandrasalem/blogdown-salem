      <title>Age of Paintings in the MoMA</title>

      <description>Preliminary Information: Note:
I realized after creating this brief that a histogram could have been more informative. Year can be interpreted as a continous variable, which would then allow us to use a histogram instead of a bar chart. I chose to interpet year as discrete and use a bar chart because I also wanted to pick out/draw attention to specific years with specific counts using annotations.

      <description>Preliminary Information: Loading libraries: library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(gapminder) library(skimr) library(scales)  Original question: Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy - you decide - a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.</description>

      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>In this theme, it is possible to add sections like a Projects one for example. You can add plenty of articles about your projects and a presentation page that will be displayed before the list. All is modulable, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want something.
A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005.</description>
