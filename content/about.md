My name is Alex Salem and I'm a Research Assistant for the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). I am also a part-time master's student in the Computer Science & Electrical Engineering department, which is the education program for CSLU.

I have a B.A. in Mathematics from Reed College in Portland, OR. 
My main interests are Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Environmental Research. My general career goals are to be a Research Scientist who uses Computer Science as a tool--but I'm not sure what kind of research I want to focus on yet.
