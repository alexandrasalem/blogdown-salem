Hello there!

My name is Alex Salem. I am a Research Assistant for the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). I am also a part-time master's student in the Computer Science & Electrical Engineering department, which is the education program for CSLU.

I have a B.A. in Mathematics from Reed College in Portland, OR. 
My main interests are Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and environmental work. 

My general career goals are to be a Research Scientist who uses Computer Science as a tool to further some important research.
